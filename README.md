# Hacktoberthon (Oct 2021)

The Umbraco Hacktoberfest Hackathon is a 24 hour virtual hackathon hosted by community members around the world. It starts at 13:00 CEST on Friday 29th October and continues until 13:00 on Saturday 30th.

Candid Contributions will be starting things off from the UK, before passing over to the Skrift team in the US. Then it’s over to Australia, before returning to Europe for the final stint. So no matter what timezone you’re in, there will be some Umbracians online to accompany you in your hacking!

There was no online guestbook this time, but we did have a (now shut) [Twitter powered cafe](https://umbrackathon.com/) to hang out in.

During the hackathon we got our own CanCon website migrated from Umbraco v8 on-premises to v9 in Umbraco Cloud. We're super grateful to those folks who helped us along the way.

After the hackathon finished [we wrote this detailed review](https://umbraco.com/blog/migrating-from-umbraco-8-on-premises-to-umbraco-9-on-cloud/) of how the migration went.
